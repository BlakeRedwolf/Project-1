## Code Explanation


### AJAX Request to CollegeScoreCard
We created a function that allowed me to make an AJAX request to the CollegeScoreCard API and then allowed me to pass through a callback function in order to further process the JSON object that was returned. 

```
var queryURL = 'https://api.data.gov/ed/collegescorecard/v1/schools?api_key=D7r68I5ZV97qXjLtrdTqnxqPTb750zgQrIaRm21s'; 
		var queryFields = '&fields=2014.student.retention_rate.four_year.full_time,2014.cost.attendance.academic_year,school.name,2014.completion.completion_rate_4yr_150nt,school.city,school.zip,school.state,school.school_url';
		queryURL += queryFields;
		var search = {};
		
		var name = $('#name').val();
		if(name.trim() != "") {
			queryURL += '&school.name=' + name;
			search['name'] = name;
		}

		var city = $('#city').val();
		if(city.trim() != ""){
			queryURL += '&school.city=' + city;
			search['city'] = city;
		}

		 $.ajax({
          url: queryURL,
          method: "GET"
        })// After data comes back from the request
        .done(function(response) {
        	app.renderSearchResult(response.results);
        })

	We also used the firebase database to restore our data.

	var app = {

   searches: {},

   dbconfig: {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyCA4hOk8RMSQ2VFfhSU_yEbax-arF8-Rps",
    authDomain: "project-1-9fe5d.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://project-1-9fe5d.firebaseio.com",
    storageBucket: "project-1-9fe5d.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "6250521181"
  },

    initFirebase:function() {
		 firebase.initializeApp(this.dbconfig);
		 this.database = firebase.database();
    },
